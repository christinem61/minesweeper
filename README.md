# Minesweeper

CS50: Intro to AI

An AI that plays Minesweeper! Built this knowledge-based agent using prepositional logic, inference algorithms/rules (such as resolution) and first-order logic.

Note: When AI is run (by clicking "AI Move"), it will not always win because there are some cases when AI must guess because it lacks sufficient information to make a safe move.
